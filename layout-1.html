			Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)

			Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is an Internet standard for electronic mail (e-mail) transmission.
			- Wikipedia
			What is SMTP?

			SMTP is a relatively simple, text-based protocol, in which a mail sender communicates with a mail receiver by issuing simple command strings and supplying necessary data over a reliable ordered data stream channel, typically Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection.
			When we send an e-mail message from our computer to another computer, it will go trough many different servers before it actually reaches our recipient's computer. The first stop for our e-mail message is an SMTP e-mail server. This server communicates directly with our computer using a protocol named SMTP. It is the de facto standard for e-mail transmission from clients to mail servers via the Internet. SMTP is an old protocol and was used already in the 1980s to transfer messages between computers.
			Its objective is to transfer mail reliably and efficiently
			SMTP is the IETF's Standard Number 10, or STD0010
			Standard e-mail formats are also closely related to the SMTP standard
